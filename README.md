## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm **Karan Verma**, a B.Tech student and a technology enthusiast with a strong grip on **modern full-stack web development** and **backend architecture**.

I specialize in crafting modular, high-performance applications with scalable REST APIs, component-driven frontend systems, and well-architected databases. I solve complex problems with efficient code and clean abstractions.

🔹 Skilled in designing robust backend systems  
🔹 Proficient in building and integrating custom APIs  
🔹 Expanding into AI/ML with hands-on use of inference models and real-time APIs  
🔹 Passionate about asynchronous programming, cloud integrations, and scalable architecture
